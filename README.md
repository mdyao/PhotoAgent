# PhotoAgent: Agentic Photo Editing with Exploratory Visual Aesthetic Planning

**[Project Page](https://mdyao.github.io/PhotoAgent/)** | **Paper (Coming)** | **Code (Coming)** | **Demo (Coming)**

PhotoAgent is an autonomous photo editing agent that formulates image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback — no step-by-step prompts required.
